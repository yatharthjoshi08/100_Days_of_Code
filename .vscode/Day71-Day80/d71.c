//Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

*/

    int len = 0;
    while (name[len] != '\0') len++;
    if (len > 0 && name[len - 1] == '\n') {
        name[len - 1] = '\0';
